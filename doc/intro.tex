\chapter{\textsc{The TXTL Modelling Toolbox}}

The TXTL modelling toolbox for MATLAB is a companion to the TXTL Breadboards (Cell-free expression) project being developed at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Minnesota. This toolbox aims to allow \textit{in-silico} prototyping of circuits before they are built \textit{in-vitro}, and to provide insight into circuit behaviour. 

	\section{Protocol Overview}

		\subsection{The TXTL Experimental Protocol}
		\subsection{The TXTL Modelling Protocol}
		The TXTL toolbox commands follow the experimental protocols closely, and a sample code is given in figure (?) below with brief explanations of the commands. More detailed explanations can be found in the 'Overview of Core Processes' chapter. More examples can be found in the 'Examples' Directory, and are documented in the 'Examples' Chapter below. \\

\noindent Sample code:

\noindent Brief explanation of commands:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Initialize Directories
	\item Extract and Buffer
	\item Newtube
	\item Adddna
	\item Combine
	\item Runsim
	\item Plot
\end{itemize}

\noindent This code produces the following figure: [add figure here]
