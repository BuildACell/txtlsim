	* txtl_prom_placI.m: corrected error in the way that reactions were
	specified

	* geneexpr.m: changed DNA separator from = to --

2012-10-01 Zoltan Tuza <zoltuz@zoltuz-laptop>

	* txtl_plot.m: added regular expression handling capability for 
	Gene Expression and DNA and mRNA plots

2012-09-29  Richard Murray  <murray@altura.local>

	* negautoreg.m: got rid of junk DNA in this example; updated
	plotting to handle new RNAP70 format (starts at zero => normalize by
	max, not initial)

	* txtl_extract.m: tweaked the RNAP + Sigma70 reaction to prevent
	generation of very stiff differential equations

	* txtl_protein_deGFP.m: commented out degradation reactions.  These

	* *.m: added TODOs

	* txtl_dna.m: added missing semicolon that was causing prepromspec
	to generate extraneous output.

	* negautoreg.m (configsetObj): ode23s is not supported in MATLAB
	2012a.  Commented out solver type; this example shoudl work with
	default solver.

	* *.m: Merged changes from Vipul and Zoltan's development branch

2012-09-12  Richard Murray  <murray@altura.local>
