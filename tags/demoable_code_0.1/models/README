This directory contains models of various biomolecular circuits.  For
now, the models are placed in subdirectories according to the source
of the models.  Eventually, we'll reorganize as we get a set of
standard components and a more unified modeling framework.

List of subdirectories:

bfs/ 	Models from the textbook Biomolecular Feedback Systems
fbs/	Models from the textbook Feedback Systems (Astrom and Murray)
txtl/	Baseline and component models for the TX-TL system
