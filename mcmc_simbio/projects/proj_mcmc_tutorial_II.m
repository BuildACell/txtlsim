%% Second tutorial for the mcmc_simbio package
% proj_mcmc_tutorial_II.m - toturial of the mcmc_simbio package
% demonstrating the estimation of parameters for a constitutive gene
% expression circuit modeled as a single enzymatic reaction. In this 
% example, we demonstrate the concurrent parameter
% estimation capability, where we have the constitutive expression circuit
% in two environments, with each environment having its own environment
% specific parameters (ESPs), while the circuit having a single set of
% circuit specific parameters.
