%% Actually before we conclude that this is not sufficiently informative to 
% make the variance blow up point, lets try just picking an arbitrary point
% (just 1) from the E2 ESP, and then actually doing a CSP ESTIMATION. I
% think in general that should cause a bad effect. 

%% part 1: First we do the median version. See stage 3 file for part 3, which 
% deals with arbitrary points. 

%% Fix ESP medians

%% Estimate CSPs in E2

%% plug into E1 and simulate

%% part 2: then we do the arbitrary point version. 


%% well it looks like this model is pretty identifiable, and so there is really no problem
% I need to find another example, where there is clear non identifiability
% and covariation between esps and csps.
